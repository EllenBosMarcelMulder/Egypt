## 🎯 What Is This?

For 50 years, the internet has had layers for transporting **bits**, **text**, and **documents** — but never a layer for transporting **meaning**.

**ASCπ** and **AMTP** change that.

This repository contains:

- A mathematical system that converts meaning into measurable values
- A protocol for transporting semantic content across any medium
- The complete specification, implementation, and prior art documentation
- Working code in Python, JavaScript, and HTML

### The Three Operators

Every piece of information — in any language — is converted to three physical values:

| Operator | Name | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **ΔΦ** | Tension | How much energy is in the information? |
| **κ** | Curvature | How complex is the structure? |
| **θ** | Phase | Where is it in the rhythm? |

This is not AI guessing. This is **mathematics measuring meaning**.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Try the Decoder (No Installation)

Open [`ASCπ_full_system_v1/AMTP_Universal_Decoder.html`](ASCπ_full_system_v1/AMTP_Universal_Decoder.html) in any browser.

### Python

```python
# See ASCπ_full_system_v1/amtp_reference.py
from amtp_reference import AMTPEncoder

encoder = AMTPEncoder()
result = encoder.encode("Hello, meaning!")
print(result.field_values)  # → {ΔΦ: 0.42, κ: 0.31, θ: 0.67}
```

### Clone & Explore

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EllenBosMarcelMulder/Egypt.git
cd Egypt/ASCπ_full_system_v1
```

## 🔬 Why This Matters

### For Computer Science

- First computational primitive beyond binary
- Computation as field evolution, not symbol manipulation
- Meaning becomes a measurable quantity

### For AI Research

- Direct semantic computation without statistical training
- Language-independent representation
- Mathematical foundation for understanding

### For The Internet

- New protocol layer (Layer 8: Meaning)
- Universal semantic transport
- Cross-language communication without translation

### For Humanity

- Published as permanent public domain
- Cannot be patented or monopolized
- Belongs to everyone

## 🌸 The Moederbloem Principle

> *"The computer is not a machine — it is a flowering implosive organism."*

The architecture is named after the **Moederbloem** (mother flower):

- **Implosion** = inner spiral (compression, insight)
- **Bloom** = outer petals (expansion, expression)
- **Global Phase** = rotational symmetry (synchronization)
