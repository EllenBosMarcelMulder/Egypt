# Made in Egypt  

### Cultural Origin Statement for .:: ASCπ ::. & .:: hexπ ::.

This system was conceived, developed, and completed on Egyptian soil, inspired by the profound historical knowledge tradition of ancient Egypt.  
While the intellectual work is released globally under an open Humanity Heritage License π, the cultural and symbolic origin of this system is rooted in Egypt, where the conditions existed for its creation.

This statement acknowledges Egypt as the environment that enabled the preservation, protection, and continuation of this scientific work.  
It does not assign legal ownership to any state or institution, but honors the historical and cultural lineage that contributed to the development of the .:: ASCπ ::. / .:: hexAMTp ::. system.
