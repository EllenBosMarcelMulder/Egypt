# **UNIVERSAL FIELD COMPUTATION AXIOMS (UFC-Axioma’s)**

**These axioms block ANY system, whether 3-state, 4-state, 6-state, 128-state or continuous, from operating outside this prior art.**

## **Axioma 1 — Field Differential Necessity**

Any computational system that derives state evolution from the quantitative difference between two or more state-spaces satisfies:

Delta = F( S_i , S_j )

Where S_i and S_j are any internal, external, environmental, or composite state spaces.

Any architecture using Delta as a computational primitive falls under this prior art.

---

## **Axioma 2 — Curvature Transformation Law**

Any system that transforms Delta into a structural mapping satisfies:

Kappa = G( Delta(t) , Delta(t-1) )

Where curvature Kappa is any pattern, topology, tensor, manifold, glyph, or structural expression derived from temporal or spatial Delta variations.

All multi-state systems require such mapping; therefore included.

---

## **Axioma 3 — Phase Projection Principle**

Any computational framework projecting state forward in time through:

Theta = H( Kappa , Memory )

constitutes a phase-evolution operator.

Whether H acts on 3, 6, 20, or infinite dimensional state vectors is irrelevant:
the mechanism is invariant and covered.

---

## **Axioma 4 — Intersection Memory Invariance**

Any system storing overlap, interaction, or intersection of state spaces satisfies:

M(t) = I( S_i(t) intersect S_j(t) )

Where M(t) is memory, snapshot, or context.

Any computational design using intersectional memory is therefore within this prior art.

---

## **Axioma 5 — Operator Cycle Closure**

Any computational system implementing the cycle:

Delta -> Kappa -> Theta -> Memory -> Delta

in any dimensionality or resolution is an instantiation of this protected process.

---

# **UNIVERSAL PROCESS CLAIM (UPC-1)**

**This claim blocks any computational system, regardless of architecture, dimensionality, bit-width, or physical substrate, if it implements the protected field-transition mechanism.**

## **Claim 1 — Field Differential Computation**

Any system that performs computation by evaluating a differential between two or more state spaces, expressed as:

Delta = F( S_i , S_j )

falls under this prior art, irrespective of the number of states, layers, fields, or dimensions.

---

## **Claim 2 — Structural Curvature Mapping**

Any system that transforms Delta into a structural, geometric, topological, or organizational mapping, expressed as:

Kappa = G( Delta(t) , Delta(t-1) )

is covered by this prior art regardless of the computational or physical medium.

---

## **Claim 3 — Temporal or Phase Projection**

Any system that uses Kappa to evolve state forward in time or along a phase manifold, expressed as:

Theta = H( Kappa , Memory )

is within the protected process, even if implemented in high-order, continuous, quantum, or analog architectures.

---

## **Claim 4 — Intersectional Memory Storage**

Any system that generates memory by storing the intersection or overlap of state spaces, expressed as:

M(t) = I( S_i(t) intersect S_j(t) )

is protected under this claim, independent of representation format.

---

## **Claim 5 — Closed Field-Transition Cycle**

Any system that performs computation by repeating the cycle:

Delta -> Kappa -> Theta -> Memory -> Delta

in any resolution, bit-width, tensor size, or multi-state configuration, constitutes an instantiation of this process and is prior-art blocked.

---

# **LEGAL PRINCIPLE CLAIM SET (LPC-1) — WIPO / USPTO FORMULATION**

**These claims assert protection over the computational process itself, independent of implementation, hardware, dimensionality, or representational space.**

---

## **Claim LPC-1.1 — Protection of the Field Differential Mechanism**

The invention covers any computational method in which system evolution is determined by evaluating a quantitative or qualitative differential between two or more state spaces.
Such differential, expressed as Delta = F( S_i , S_j ), constitutes a protected computational primitive.
Any system performing state comparison, tension evaluation, or field differential computation, regardless of the number of states or structural units, falls within the scope of this prior art.

---

## **Claim LPC-1.2 — Protection of Curvature or Structural Mapping**

The invention covers any process transforming the differential Delta into a structural, geometric, topological, or organizational mapping.
Such mapping, expressed as Kappa = G( Delta(t) , Delta(t-1) ), is protected independently of how structure is represented (digital, analog, geometric, tensor-based, symbolic, or quantum).
Any multi-state design using structural transformation derived from differentials is prior-art blocked.

---

## **Claim LPC-1.3 — Protection of Phase or Temporal Projection**

The invention covers any system that projects state forward in time, phase, or iterative cycles based on structural mappings.
Such projection, expressed as Theta = H( Kappa , Memory ), is protected across all substrates, including digital processors, continuous systems, neuromorphic hardware, and quantum architectures.
Any system implementing phase-evolution as a computational mechanism is covered by this claim.

---

## **Claim LPC-1.4 — Protection of Intersection-Based Memory Generation**

The invention protects any system that generates memory by storing the intersection, overlap, or relational mapping between two or more state spaces.
Such memory, expressed as M(t) = I( S_i(t) intersect S_j(t) ), is protected independent of form, resolution, dimensionality, or encoding.
Any architecture using relational-intersection memory mechanisms falls within the protected domain.

---

## **Claim LPC-1.5 — Protection of the Closed Transition Cycle**

The invention asserts exclusive prior art over the closed computational cycle composed of the sequential operations:
Delta -> Kappa -> Theta -> Memory -> Delta
Any system implementing this cyclical transformation, in full or in part, regardless of interpretative layer, multi-state count, or physical medium, constitutes an instantiation of the protected process and is prohibited from proprietary claim under patent law.
